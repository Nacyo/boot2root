# Security project
For obvious reasons, solutions to this project are not in this repository


## Objectives

This project aims to make you discover, through several small challenges, computer security in several areas.
The methods you will use, more or less complex, will make you see different computer systems.

## Instructions

* This project will only be corrected by humans.
* You may be required, during your defense, to prove your results. You have to prepare for it.
* You will have to use a virtual machine (64 bits) to do this project. Once your machine is launched with the ISO provided with the subject, if everything is well configured, you will only have a simple prompt.
* For some levels you will have to use one or more external software, in this case we strongly advise you to automate the procedure via scripts at least.
* You must not modify this ISO, or create an altered copy.
* Nothing is left to chance. In case of problems, ask yourself first of all if there is not a problem on your side.
* Your rendering folder should only contain the things that allowed you to solve the iso. The writeup must be written in French or English. Each step must be detailed
* If you need to use a specific file present on the ISO of the project, you must download it in defense. You must not under any circumstances put this one in your deposit.
* In the case of using specific external software, you must prepare a specific environment (VM, docker, Vagrant).
* The creation of script in order to save time is encouraged, but a detailed explanation can be requested in defense.
* As part of your mandatory game, you must simply exploit the iso in two different ways.
* ATTENTION: Everything that is present in this file must be able to be explained clearly without any hesitation. NO binary should be present in this folder.
